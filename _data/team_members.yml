   info: William’s research aims are to develop better ways to build useful risk and decision making techniques, using a combination of data and knowledge (or expertise). He mainly works with Bayesian networks and prefers to work with ‘end users’ who are making decisions. He is currently collaborating with several groups of clinicians to build decision support systems for medical decision problems.
