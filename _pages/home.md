We are a dynamic research group at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl). Our aim is to explore and understand [quantum materials](http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.nl/2013/05/what-is-quantum-matter.html), including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter.


To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want do be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).


 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
