**KNIFE (Knowledge Discovery from Health Use Data)** is a Turing Institute funded project led by Dr William Marsh, with co-investigators Prof Norman Fenton, Prof Martin Neil, and Dr John Robson.

The increasing use and capability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems has made available large databases of patient records, linked across different health providers. These databases contain information about patientsâ€™ use of the different health services, treatments and prescriptions. The data, collected for clinical management or financial reporting, has many actual and potential uses including discovering causes, optimising health delivery, allocating resources and choosing treatment. However, there are both practical and technical challenges to overcome before these benefits can be achieved. The overall objective of the project is to lay the foundations for a transformative approach to patient-linked health data, making it accessible for both medical and data science researchers to fully exploit. We will achieve this by working with two groups who are custodians of data of this type in East London.

##### **Task 1: Data Description at Several Levels of Abstraction.**

*  Create a simplified model of the data generation process, covering the organisations involved,
using a mix of text and diagrams.
*  Create a semantic schema, using web ontology techniques or related techniques [4]. We will
also investigate the use and role of the medical ontologies used to tag data (primarily SNOMED).
*  Investigate the mapping between the semantic schema and the storage schema, its use for data
access and the potential for automating its construction.
This task will result in a description of the data that can be shared with potential collaborators. A
complete data dictionary may not be necessary if the same concepts recur in different parts of the data.
