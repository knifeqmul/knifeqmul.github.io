CCG holds a data repository that links pseudonymised patient level records across health and care settings.

## Issues
1. Data is in CCG, while GPs are located in clinics.
2. Data is semi-structured without clear description.



## To do
1. Ontology.
2. EHR applications.
3. Causal hypothesis testing.
