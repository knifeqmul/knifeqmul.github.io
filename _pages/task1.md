#### **Task 1: Data Description at Several Levels of Abstraction.**

*  Create a simplified model of the data generation process, covering the organisations involved, using a mix of text and diagrams.
*  Create a semantic schema, using web ontology techniques or related techniques. We will also investigate the use and role of the medical ontologies used to tag data (primarily SNOMED).
*  Investigate the mapping between the semantic schema and the storage schema, its use for data access and the potential for automating its construction.

This task will result in a description of the data that can be shared with potential collaborators. A complete data dictionary may not be necessary if the same concepts recur in different parts of the data.
