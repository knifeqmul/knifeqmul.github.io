#### **Task 5: Outreach and consortium building.**

This task will be to build a consortium of researcher to collaborate on future work. Guided by the leadership of the Turing Health Programme, we will identify and contact potential collaborators. Workshops (or a workshop) will be run to share ideas and we expect to prepare follow-up proposals.
