#### **Workshop: A workshop about medical data and SNOMED was conducted at 3 July 2019.**

*  Elicit from data custodians the uses of the data and categorise the data analytic challenges. We will consider both what is currently possible and what might be achieved in future.
*  Review available statistical / ML (including SRL) techniques against the data analytic requirements.
*  Investigate how causal knowledge could be elicited and modelled for data of this complexity (with examples, if possible).
*  If possible, carry out ‘proof of concepts’ analyses, using either real or synthetic data (Task 2).

The task will result in a clearer definition in the data analysis and knowledge modelling research needs, distinguishing these from what can be achieved with current techniques.
